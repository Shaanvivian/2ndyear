            We've boasted of being <b>perfect</b> for so long! Until recently it came up that we probably aren't. 
            Somehow, that didn't bother me. It felt like we're finally getting there! You know how they say <i>"honeymoon period"</i>
            well, it felt like after almost two years we're seeing the real picture, the bigger picture. We've grown beyond the beauties of getting to know eachother. 
            We're growing into becoming something together. We've properly embraced being a couple, acknowledging that everything is not perfect and it doesn't have to be.
            As long as it's you and me together with the strength to fight everything that troubles us celebrate everything that we achieve,<br>
            <b><em>we're as perfect as perfect can be!</em></b><br><br>
            You give me strength! More than you know, and that has helped me flourish in so many ways. You've been there in my lows and you're the reason for most of my highs!
            you make everything worthy of celebration! <br>
            You make me want to excel, and out-do myself so that I can share it with you and find joy in it. This is probably also an attempt to that.
        <br> <br>
            Now I know I mentioned honeymoon period, and yes I did a lot of thinking and overthinking!
            It made me realize that we've changed a lot from what we began as. That didn't really disappoint me although it did make me sad. 
            It made me sad to realize that there were so many things that used to be our thing, which we haven't done in a long time! 
            <ul>
                <Li>sending emails</Li>
                <li>watching movies online</li>
                <li>sending romantic messages</li>
                <li>so many more</li>
            </ul>
            It's been a while, but it won't be forever! As we walk into this phase of <b>US</b> I want to assure you that we're gonna invest in ourselves!
            I promise to be your strength at all times, I promise to be your confidante without any judgement, and I promise to be your best-friend!
            <br>
            I often think about how we got here, all the way from G-slam to now, being insanely in love with you and it really makes my heart swell with joy
            because I wouldn't have it any other way. It's funny how we almost gave up on this, but never again! my love and my heart, it belong to you now;
            And I promise to live a life that will only help us have a safer and stronger future together. 
            Time for making the dreams come true is now baby. We're gonna get this! <br>
            On that note, I miss watching you do your coding workshops! I remember trying to learn and keep up with you on that session.<br>
            I failed miserably, but here I am. and fun fact, today is June 7th and you're sitting on call with me and I'm smiling away like there's no tomorrow
            because I can't wait to show this to you and see your reaction!<br>
            I particularly wanted to do this, to show that I love you Srinija! 
            And I will do everything it takes to never let our spark dim. 
            I will never stop working on us, and putting efforts to make sure we're in the best shape of our lives. 
            <br>
            Now, when I say shape of our lives, don't assume I meant physically, I'm not getting on a diet (although i can't wait to burn calories because of you) <br>
            <b>I LOVE YOU</b>
